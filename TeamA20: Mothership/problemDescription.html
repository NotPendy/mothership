<h1 align="center"> Mothership </h1>

<p> The goal of this project is to develop and demonstrate a
mothership setup with a fixed wing carrier (or airship ;-), capable of
launching <i>and recovering</i> one or more smaller drones (probably
multicopters).



<p>To successfully complete this project you need to have:
<ul>
<li> At least two pilots (one for mothership and one for the little one).
<li> Inclination to build complex systems.
</ul>

<h3> Deliverables </h3>

<ul>
<li> Demonstration 
<li> Well commented code and schematics
<li> Documentation for the resulting system
<li> Report
</ul>
